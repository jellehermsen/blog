Microserviced my dismay  
Loosely coupled  
Sound design  
Proven properties  
Prove each time  
This web is good  
And I am fine  

Reach my progressive API  
And scriptures on your client  
Show working servers, idle time  
Grand and unreliant  

Mass-approval crossing networks  
Cached in storage localized  
Your feelings are not even yours  
My feelings are not mine  

We view this microserviced corpse  
We pass it thumbs and grime  
But do not worry, we are here  
And we are doing fine
