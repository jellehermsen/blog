I recently read [this blog
post](http://rickcarlino.com/2018/07/11/fabulous-text-only-websites-2018-edition-html.html)
by Rick Carlino about fabulous text only websites and decided to redesign my
blog, or more precisely: undesign my blog.

I have ripped out most of the CSS and used the styles from
[bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) as a
starting point. HasClunk already outputs pretty minimal HTML5, so that's good.

I'm quite happy with the result. In Lynx there's not that much of a difference,
but I really enjoy the lightweight look in the browser.

While I was at it, I also removed all the embedded music players from
Soundcloud and Jamendo. They added all kinds of nasty JavaScript and tracking
stuff to my site and don't want to expose all my non-existing visitors to that
kind of stuff :-).
