Tomorrow I will be giving a talk on visual programming languages at the
University of Twente during FP-Day 2015. I will later post my slides and full
text here, for your enjoyment.

Here’s the abstract for my talk:

Visual languages: functional programming in the era of jab and smoosh
Abstract: Why are we still typing our code? We have made the jump from keypunch
machines to text terminals, but our programming hasn’t fully entered the bird
slinging, candy crushing age of touchy swipy goodness. Are programmers the
latest luddites or is it impossible to graphically capture the complexity of
computing? In this talk we will look at visual programming and especially the
way in which a pure functional approach might help create a general-purpose
language that is both easy on the eyes and in touch with modern times.
