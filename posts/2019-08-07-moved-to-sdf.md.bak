title: Blog moved to SDF
categories: general, english
-->
I have moved my weblog to the MetaArray at [SDF](https://sdf.org). I will be
using [jelle.xyz](https://jelle.xyz) as the site for my job as a freelance
programmer, so I needed a new location for my blog. I'm very fond of SDF and
love their stance on preserving old tech that deserves preserving. They are a
big lot of \*nix minded folks with great affection for terminals, NetBSD,
Gopher and old school bulletin boards.

In the next couple of months I want to move all my old blog posts to this
place. There's some old weblogs floating about, and some archives I have backed
up, and I want to bring that all here. After all that I might write about the
stuff I'm doing these days and whatever sparks my interests.

Ps: SSL is not yet working. I hope that it will soon, but I'm dependant on the
generosity of the MetaArray's admins to fix my virtual host.
