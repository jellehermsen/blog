A couple of weeks ago I did some digging around in the attic (literally :-). And
I came across a burned cd with a bunch of old tracks I made in the 90's. I was
using FastTracker II on my trusty 486 running DOS. 

Long story cut short: I took a couple of songs, and mixed them
into a new up and downtempo track and shoved them onto the interwebs.

You can listen to the album on
[Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/album/168049/exhumed-but-not-dead) and
