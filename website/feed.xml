title: Rise of the videogame zinesters
categories: gamedev
--> 
<p>Last week I read Anna Anthropy's <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781609803728">Rise of the videogame zinesters</a> and it left a big impression on me. Having read a lot of books on video games, this one is something completely different. No programmer semi-gods this time (like in Masters of Doom or Hackers), no tough stories about manly men working 100 hour weeks in crunch mode (like in Jacked). No: this book is about human beings making games, everybody, not just the prototypical hetero cis men who have dominated gamer culture for so long.</p>

<p>Anthropy paints a bright picture in which games are created like ezines. She makes a very good point about video games needing more diverse personal voices and you don't need to be a coder to let yours be heard. Mentioning a couple of tools you can use to make games without previous programming experience (like Twine), and talking about various examples, she convincingly attempts to liberate the art form from its prison in which men shooting men in the face is the norm.</p>
<p><br/> This book appealed to me in so many ways it's hard to summarize. Triple A games and gamer culture create an ecosystem which is often weird and off-putting for queer folk like me, so Anthropy's inclusive stance is heartwarming. Creating a game yourself seems daunting, even to me, and I am nota bene a coder. Anthropy emphasizes the fact that you should just go and create, build stuff and don't worry if it sucks. The result will always be personal and that's something worthy and special in it's own right! This is such a beautiful thought I actually read the end in tears.</p>
<p>I still love the books on games and game developers I have on my shelves and can never get tired about reading how John Carmack and Romero did their magic with ID software, but this book resonated with me in a way I never thought possible on this subject. If you want to create games like me, or you would like to read how this art form is opening up to a wider range of voices, I really can't recommend it enough!</p>

<title>Herding Cats</title>

title: Herding Cats
categories: games

<p>I have just started reading <a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/?p=1583">Rise of the Videogame Zinesters</a> by Anna Anthropy and while I was looking at the games she made I found this little puzzle gem in her list: <a href="http://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=0ce1a363836151b78be0">Herding Cats</a>.</p>

<p>Herding Cats is a top down puzzler in the style of Sokoban/Paganitzu/Adventures of Lolo with a very neat twist. Instead of pushing boxes around and blocking baddies, you have to herd cats. The mechanic is as simple as it is tricky, because the cats stick to you once you get next to their block and they will remain by your side for the entire session. Thankfully you can undo moves, and - trust me - you will need this. You can easily end up with too many sticky cats, meaning you can't get past a narrow part.</p>
<p>I love the way the cats' furs change color each time you reload a level and I'm quite envious of the player's pink hair. Tried to do that once, but my hair's too dark to get properly blonde for coloring.</p>
<p>Herding Cats is pretty neat and difficult, but (thankfully) easy enough to finish in your average coffee break. The perfect kind of game for days like these when I'm surfing a deadline's waves like I never managed to pull of in California Games.</p>

<title>New blog</title>
<link>http://jelle.aard.xyz/posts/2015-07-21-new_blog.html</link><guid>http://jelle.aard.xyz/posts/2015-07-21-new_blog.html</guid>

title: New blog
categories: general

<p>Greetings and salutations visitor. This is my new weblog, using the brand spanking new static weblog generator <a href="https://github.com/jellehermsen/HasClunk">HasClunk</a>.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to use <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, but couldn't get it setup because of the dreaded Cabal dependecy hell raining down errors on me. Usually when such a thing happens, I will just keep on twiddling till it's done, but not this time. I figured I could build my own static blog generator quickly, so I just went at it.</p>
<p>HasClunk supports posts, pages, categories and RSS. It's everything I need at the moment. I might add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a> support later on, because that kind of fits the <a href="http://aard.xyz">Aardvark community</a>. Aardvark is a network of people who (mostly) met at <a href="http://sdf.org">SDF</a> and started their own IRC server when SDF was having some downtime because of DDOS attacks. <a href="http://cultofbob.com">Nismorack</a> calls us paleotechnologists and this makes sense, because most of use love to use terminals instead of desktop environments, and we're working on our own BBS. You can even visit us on <a href="gopher://aard.xyz/">Gopher</a>.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a Haskell and general code geek, so much of this blog will be about those subjects. I'm also working on game ideas that I would love to see come to life, but don't hold your breath for them. In the mean time I work as a freelance medical programmer and I like playing and reading about indie games. The indie game scene is awesome and I'm a big fan of the growing diversity, gripping games out of the cold dead white masculine hands and make them rainbow colored!</p>
