title: About me
-->
Hi there fellow traveler of the cyberspaciousness. I'm Jelle: a programmer and
FLOSS enthusiast from the Netherlands. During the day I work at
[Noest](https://noest.io/) and [Jelle.xyz](https://jelle.xyz), during the night
I play indie games, try to [make them with Simone
Bruhn](https://plumpdevs.com), make music, write poetry, code on various
projects, watch 80s comedies and read fantasy / sci-fi books.
