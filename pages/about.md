title: About me
-->
Hi there fellow traveler of the cyberspaciousness. I'm Jelle: a programmer and
FLOSS enthusiast from the Netherlands. During the day I work at
[UWKM](http://uwkm.nl/), during the night I play indie games, make music, write
poetry, code on various projects, watch 80s comedies and read fantasy / sci-fi
books.

My fav OS is GNU/Linux, my editor of choice is VIM, my desktop runs Xmonad and
I'm really into functional programming (especially Haskell). I'm queer and drink
my coffee black.
