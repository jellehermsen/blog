title: About me
-->
Hi there fellow traveler of the cyberspaciousness. I am Jelle Hermsen: a
programmer and FLOSS enthusiast from the Netherlands. I work as a [freelance
programmer](https://jelle.xyz/) making websites, apps and all kinds of "behind
the scenes" tech magic :-). I'm also an indie game developer. Together with Simone
Bruhn I make games as [Plump Devs](https://plumpdevs.com).

In my spare time I love making music, writing poetry, watch 80s comedies and
read fantasy and sci-fi novels.
